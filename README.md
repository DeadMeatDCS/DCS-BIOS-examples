# DCS-BIOS-examples
Example sketches for DCS-BIOS

## MagSwitch_Hornet_HID_Joy
Sketch containing code for all Hornet mag switches using the HID workaround I pioneered.

*Implemented using a [HID Joystick library](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) instead of the old Keyboard.h approach.*


Tested with DCS-BIOS, flight panels fork.
